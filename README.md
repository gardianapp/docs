# Gardian documentation

Currently Gardian is in development. Follow our progress at [gardian.nl](http://gardian.nl).

## Feature requests/suggestions

You are probably checking this repo because you want to code some kind of integration with Gardian.
We are not yet at the point to provide an API but suggestions about what kind of endpoints should be available are always welcome!
Request can be made either here on Github or contact us at [hallo@gardian.nl](mailto:hallo@gardian.nl).
